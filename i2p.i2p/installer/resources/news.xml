<h3>2011-10-20: <b>0.8.10 <a href="http://www.i2p2.i2p/release-0.8.10.html">Released</a></b></h3>

<p>
Release 0.8.10 includes two changes intended to reduce the number of router-to-router connections,
and therefore improve tunnel build success rates and general reliability.
Of course, there's also a few bug fixes and translation updates.

The network has grown quite rapidly in recent weeks, and that's great news,
but it has caused some instability. We welcome all our new users and we
ask you to be patient as we make improvements to the software.
