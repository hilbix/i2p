Release checklist
-----------------

Sync with mtn.i2p2.i2p
Start with a clean checkout mtn -d i2p.mtn co --branch=i2p.i2p
Double-check trust list
Deploy the Jetty archive, a clean checkout lacks it

Change revision in:
	history.txt
	installer/install.xml
	installer/resources/news.xml
	router/java/src/net/i2p/router/RouterVersion.java
		(change to BUILD = 0 and EXTRA = "")
	core/java/src/net/i2p/CoreVersion.java

Review the complete diff from the last release:
        mtn diff -r t:i2p-0.7.(xx-1) > out.diff
        vi out.diff

Verify that no untrusted revisions were inadvertently
blessed by a trusted party:
        mtn log --brief --no-graph --to t:i2p-0.8.(xx-1) | cut -d ' ' -f 2 | sort | uniq -c

NOTE: Most tasks below here are now automated by 'ant release'

Build and tag:
	ant pkg
	mtn ci
	mtn tag h: i2p-0.7.xx
	mtn cert t:i2p-0.7.xx branch i2p.i2p.release
	Sync with mtn.i2p2.i2p

Create a signed update file with:
	export I2P=~/i2p
	java -cp $I2P/lib/i2p.jar net.i2p.crypto.TrustedUpdate sign i2pupdate.zip i2pupdate.sud /path/to/private.key 0.7.xx

Verify signed update file with:
	java -cp $I2P/lib/i2p.jar net.i2p.crypto.TrustedUpdate showversion i2pupdate.sud
	java -cp $I2P/lib/i2p.jar net.i2p.crypto.TrustedUpdate verifysig i2pupdate.sud

Make the source tarball:
	Start with a clean checkout mtn -d i2p.mtn co --branch=i2p.i2p i2p-0.7.xx
        Double-check trust list
	tar cjf i2psource-0.7.xx.tar.bz2 --exclude i2p-0.7.xx/_MTN i2p-0.7.xx	
	mv i2p-0.7.xx.tar.bz2 i2p.i2p

Until the build script gets this ability, you need to rename some files:
	mv i2pinstall.exe i2pinstall-0.7.xx.exe
	mv i2pupdate.zip i2pupdate-0.7.xx.zip
	you probably don't need to rename i2pupdate.sud

Generate hashes:
	sha256sum i2p*0.7.xx.*
	sha256sum i2pupdate.sud
	now GPG-sign an announcement with the hashes

Generate PGP signatures:
	gpg -b i2pinstall-0.7.xx.exe
	gpg -b i2psource-0.7.xx.tar.bz2
	gpg -b i2pupdate-0.7.xx.zip
	gpg -b i2pupdate.sud

(end of tasks automated by 'ant release')

	announcements_*.html
